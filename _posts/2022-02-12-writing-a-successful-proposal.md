Writing a good proposal for a project is an important step to getting admitted into GSoC. This page lists tips for submitting GSoC proposals to MoMA Lab and the template that your proposal should follow. For more information on writing a quality GSoC project proposal refer to the official [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

## Tips
- Make a realistic estimation of your daily time budget and the time you will be unavailable (e.g: studying for exams, traveling, family commitments etc.), and inform the mentors in advance.
- Split the greater project into smaller steps with deliverables and milestones that you will place in a [Gant chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart) in your proposal.
- List channels of communication on which you will be generally available for mentors to contact you.
- Be honest about your technical capabilities with respect to the Required and Preferred skills listed in the description of the project you are proposing.
- Submit a complete draft of your proposal as early as possible. This will allow MoMA mentors to review your proposal early and get back to you regarding feedback and questions that can help you strengthen your final proposal.
- Be specific and realistic about the work described in your proposal. GSoC runs for 12 weeks and this year will support Medium (\~175h of work) and Large (\~350h of work) sized projects. Depending on the type of project you are proposing, outline details about the work that you propose and avoid widening the work scope too much. If you are excited about an idea which you believe might be too wide in scope, feel free to contact us and we can guide you accordingly to building a realistically achievable proposal.
- Projects in the Idea List feature a short description which is meant as inspiration. A good proposal builds on and adds to the idea rather than just repeat the essence of the limited description.
