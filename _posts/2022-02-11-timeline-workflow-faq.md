## Workflow
The workflow of each GSoC project is unique. On a communication levels, MoMA mentors and GSoC Contributors are expected to schedule a one-on-one meeting at least once a week. Intermediate communication can happen through the lab's Slack workspace which Contributors are expected to join when their projects get accepted. Beyond this, GSoC Contributors are expected to join the MoMA weekly Zoom call with their mentors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: Yes. GSoC allows Contributors to submit up to three project proposals. You can also spread your proposals across organizations to improve your chances of getting admitted.

A: No. Proposals are submitted through the Google Summer of Code Website. However, you can reach out to MoMA to discuss a draft you have submitted.

- Q: Do GSoC Contributors get paid?  
A: Yes. Contributors who successfully complete the program are paid a stipend by Google. More information can be found on the GSoC website.

- Q: Will I get paid even if MoMA doesn't end up using my code?  
A: Yes.

- Q: How much time does GSoC participation take?  
A: The time you spend on your GSoC project depends on the type of project (Medium \~175h, Large \~350h) and your technical abilities.
